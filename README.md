# php-login

Simple PHP app for an assignment I had for my web development course.

Uses the `m3-app` component from my (currently private) Material You Expressive web components.

The database details are public for the sake of showcase. Obviously in a production environment this would never go well, but the app itself is sandboxed in its own container on my server.
